        <h1>Brownies</h1>
        <p>Brownies can be easily made from a box mix, but sometimes a homemade batch just hits the spot! These <a href="Notes.htm">gluten-free brownies</a> are delicious and chocolate-y. Paired with a vanilla, coffee, or other ice cream of your choosing, it's hard to beat!</p>
        <p>This recipe technically makes 16 servings, although realistically, it'll be more like 8. Who ever stopped at a single serving of a brownie?</p>
