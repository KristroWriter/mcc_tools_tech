        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>History and Set Up</h2>
        <p>Trufflemania was born in the late 1980s. It began as a small group of editors working out of a Sudbury, MA, kitchen. </p>
        <h2>Format</h2>
        <p>The idea was based on a cookie swap, except the swap was going to be truffles. Each person would make a different flavor center, and then the group would gather and dip each center in melted chocolate and decorate with toppings. The truffles would be cooled and then each person would take a share of the results.</p>
        <h2>The Great Truffle Schism</h2>
        <p> For quite a few years--about five--the group worked well together. People brought different flavors, the group grew, and Trufflemania became an all-day affair. But, with growth came differing philosophies. Some people wanted to try new flavors and different chocolates. Others wanted more volume of truffles to take home. Things needed to change and the great Truffle Schism was upon us. </p>
        <p>One group stayed in Sudbury, and the other group moved north initially to Littleton and ultimately to changing locations. Trufflemania West in the tradition of other ousted groups, followed a more radical and creative format--trying new flavors, new chocolates, and new methodologies. </p>
        <p>We are happy to include those who enter into making truffles with curiosity, creativity, and a humble attitude--because chocolate will sometimes defeat you. </p>
