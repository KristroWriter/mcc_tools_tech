        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Avoid Water:</b> Never allow water or steam, not even the smallest drop, to get into a pan of chocolate.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Avoid Humidity: </b>This means that winter in New England is a good time for truffle making. Summer, not so much. <b></b></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Avoid High Heat:</b> Melt chocolate over warm water in a double boiler, stirring constantly. Otherwise the chocolate can become discolored.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Moral of the story: It’s pretty easy as long as you keep water out of the ganache !</p>

        <h1><big>Dipping Chocolate</big>
        </h1>
        <p>Our group adds 1/4 cup canola oil to every pound of chocolate melted for dipping. Chocolate should be cooled to between 80 and 100 degrees F before dipping centers in it; otherwise it will form too thin a coating (not to mention melting any centers that are soft to begin with, such as the whiskey raisin). We have tried several times to temper the chocolate which means heating and cooling the chocolate to achieve results that are similar to (and better) than those achieved with the oil. However, because we are dealing with hundreds of truffles, we have found that tempering is difficult to achieve. It is best with small batches. </p>
