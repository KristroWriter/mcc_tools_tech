Transfer to covered bowl and place a layer of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the ganache and up the sides of the bowl to prevent water from condensing onto it.

        <p MadCap:conditions="Truffle set.PrintOnly">Dip</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Cognac-Walnut Truffles</p>
        <p>This makes about 100 pieces</p>
        <p>Ganache:</p>
        <p>24 oz. dark chocolate (Callebaut or Ghirardelli are best)</p>
        <p>1 cup heavy cream (not whipping cream)</p>
        <p>6 Tablespoons Cognac (I use Stock brand brandy)</p>
        <p>200 Walnut Halves (I get them at Trader Joe's)</p>
        <p>In double-boiler, melt chocolate together with cream, heating gently</p>
        <p>and stirring until well blended, smooth and homogeneous. Cover bowl</p>
        <p>with plastic wrap, making sure plastic touches surface of ganache all</p>
        <p>across to seal out water and air. When ready, form ganache into</p>
        <p>balls about the size of a marble or slightly larger, and sandwich each</p>
        <p>ball between two walnut halves.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Chocolate-Hazelnut Truffles</p>
        <p>Makes about 4 dozen truffles</p>
        <p>1/2 cup hazelnuts</p>
        <p>9 oz semisweet or dark sweet chocolate, broken into small pieces (NOT chocolate chips)</p>
        <p>1 c heavy cream</p>
        <p>4 tbsp unsalted butter</p>
        <p>3 tbsp Frangelico liqueur</p>
        <p>Day 1:</p>
        <p>Heat oven to 350°F.</p>
        <p>Toast hazelnuts in shallow baking pan 15 minutes, shaking pan occasionally. Transfer nuts to coarse sieve; rub around, using cloth to protect your hand, until skins have come off. Let cool completely.</p>
        <p>When hazelnuts have cooled, select 48 nuts of uniform size; store in tightly covered container, in refrigerator, for later use as decoration. Chop remaining nuts coarsely (you should have about 1/4 c).</p>
        <p>Place chocolate, cream, and butter in top of double boiler; heat over simmering water, stirring often with wooden spoon. When chocolate has melted, beat with spoon until smooth. Remove from heat; let cool to room temperature.</p>
        <p>When ganache is cool, stir in Frangelico and chopped hazelnuts until well combined and transfer to medium bowl. Refrigerate, covered with foil, overnight or up to several days to allow ganache to ripen and harden.</p>
        <p>Day 2:</p>
        <p>Working with a small amount of the ganache at a time and keeping remainder refrigerated, form into balls about 1 inch in diameter, using about 1 tsp of ganache per ball; work with fingertips, not palms of hands, to keep ganache from softening too much. Place on baking sheet lined with waxed paper. When sheet is full, refrigerate until truffles are somewhat firm (about 1 hour), then cover loosely with waxed paper and refrigerate until quite firm and set (1-2 days).</p>
        <p>Day 3 or 4:</p>
        <p>Dip</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Chocolate Espresso Kahlua Truffles</p>
        <p>Adapted from a recipe in Gourmet, February 1996</p>
        <p>Makes about 40 truffles.</p>
        <p>12 ounces fine-quality semisweet chocolate, chopped</p>
        <p>1/2 stick (1/4 cup) unsalted butter, cut into pieces</p>
        <p>1/4 cup heavy cream</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon instant espresso powder dissolved in 1 tablespoon boiling water</p>
        <p>4 tablespoons Kahlua (original recipe calls for 2 tablespoons Sambuca or other anise liqueur)</p>
        <p>[about 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder for coating truffles]</p>
        <p>In a double boiler or in a metal bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water melt chocolate and butter with cream and espresso, stirring until smooth. Remove top of double boiler or bowl from heat and stir in liqueur. Cool mixture and chill, covered, at least 3 hours, or until firm.</p>
        <p>Form rounded teaspoons of mixture into balls [and roll balls in cocoa powder, coating them]. Truffles keep, layered between sheets of wax paper and chilled, in airtight containers 2 weeks.</p>
        <p>(Note: Several reviewers at the Epicurious.com site said that this is a great base recipe for adding any kind of liqueur. It does seem to take a larger amount of liquor without yielding an overly soft ganache, perhaps because of the butter.)</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Grand Marnier</p>
        <p>Makes about 100 Truffles.</p>
        <p>21 oz. chocolate (I used half 60%, half semi sweet)</p>
        <p>2 cups heavy cream</p>
        <p>4 Tbsp unsalted butter</p>
        <p>10 Tbsp Grand Marnier</p>
        <p>Framboise</p>
        <p>Makes about 100 Truffles.</p>
        <p>21 oz. chocolate (I used half 60%, half semi sweet)</p>
        <p>2 cups heavy cream</p>
        <p>4 Tbsp unsalted butter</p>
        <p>10 Tbsp Framboise</p>
        <p><b>Mexican Molé Truffles</b>
        </p>
        <p>Makes about 25 truffles</p>
        <p>1 cup heavy cream</p>
        <p>1/4 tsp. chipotle chile powder</p>
        <p>1/2 tsp. cinnamon</p>
        <p>1/2 tsp. coriander</p>
        <p>1/2 tsp. allspice</p>
        <p>1 pinch nutmeg</p>
        <p>1 pinch cumin</p>
        <p>8 oz. dark chocolate, finely chopped</p>
        <p>extra cinnamon and coriander for dusting  (~ 5 to 1 mix)</p>
        <p>In a double boiler, whisk the spices into the cream, being sure to break up any clumps. Heat the cream to about 90 degrees. Remove from heat. Add the chocolate and stir until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture is smooth. Transfer mixture to a bowl; cool to room temperature then cover with plastic wrap and chill completely.</p>
        <p>Roll chilled ganache into 1” balls.</p>
        <p>Dip, then dust with cinnamon and coriander.</p>
        <p>Lime-Ginger Truffles</p>
        <p>Makes about 25 truffles</p>
        <p>1 cup heavy cream</p>
        <p>8 oz. semi-sweet chocolate, finely chopped</p>
        <p>2 tsp. lime zest</p>
        <p>ground ginger for dusting</p>
        <p>In a double boiler, heat the cream to about 90 degrees. Remove from heat. Add the chocolate and stir until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture is smooth.</p>
        <p>Let ganache rest 5 minutes, then stir in lime zest. Transfer mixture to a bowl; cool to room temperature then cover with plastic wrap and chill completely.</p>
        <p>Roll chilled ganache into 1” balls.</p>
        <p>Dip, then dust with ground ginger.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Truffles Au Paprika (Deviled Chocolate Truffles)</p>
        <p>(To get about 96 truffles, I multiplied this recipe times 5.)</p>
        <p>5 ounces unsweetened chocolate (I used semi-sweet)</p>
        <p>1 cup cream (heavy)</p>
        <p>1 1/2 ounces prunes</p>
        <p>1 ounce armagnac</p>
        <p>1/2 tablespoon cocoa powder</p>
        <p>1/2 tablespoon paprika, sweet (or mild)</p>
        <p>Warm the Armagnac and soak the pitted and roughly chopped prunes in the brandy until they are soft.</p>
        <p>Melt the chocolate.</p>
        <p>Bring the cream just to a boil and take off heat and mix into the melted chocolate.</p>
        <p>Allow to cool.</p>
        <p>Finely chop the prunes and add the prunes and any unabsorbed brandy into the cooled chocolate mixture. (Next time I might use the cuisinart to chop prunes. I tried to chop fine with a knife, but they were still a bit chunkier than I wanted.)</p>
        <p>Chill until firm but not hard.</p>
        <p>Mix cocoa powder and paprika on flat plate. Roll the chocolate mixture into small balls and roll each ball in the cocoa/paprika mixture.</p>
        <p>Store in a cool place.</p>
        <p>NOTE: I did not roll the balls in paprika. I mixed paprika into the chocolate/cream mixture because we were going to dip the truffles. Maybe we should try some truffles just rolled in cocoa or other things next year.</p>
        <p>NOTE 2: I was worried about this recipe that I pulled from the Internet. The proportions of the cream to chocolate did not seem to match other recipes. I did end up adding more chocolate to the mixture because I felt that it would not congeal properly. HOWEVER, next time, I think I might just try following the recipe exactly because I think the paprika truffle centers are a bit hard.</p>
        <p>NOTE 3 (from Natalie, 2007):  Following the recipe exactly yielded a ganache that never firmed up enough to roll, so I changed the proportions and added some butter:</p>
        <p>5 oz chocolate (1/2 Ghiradelli 60% chips, 1/2 Ghiradelli semi-sweet chips)</p>
        <p>1/2  cup cream</p>
        <p>1 Tbsp. butter</p>
        <p>2 1/2  Tbsp. Cognac</p>
        <p>1 1/2  oz. prunes</p>
        <p>2 tsp. paprika</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Honey Spice Truffles</p>
        <p>(Multiplied recipe times 5)</p>
        <p>5 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, finely chopped</p>
        <p>1/2 cup whipping cream</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon vanilla or 1/4 vanilla bean (split and scraped) Note: I always use double strength vanilla.</p>
        <p>1/2 cinnamon stick</p>
        <p>1 whole clove</p>
        <p>1 1/2 tablespoons honey</p>
        <p>Pinch of salt</p>
        <p>1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter, room temperature</p>
        <p>8 ounces bittersweet chocolate</p>
        <p>Place the semisweet chocolate in a medium-sized mixing bowl and set aside.</p>
        <p>In a small saucepan, combine the cream, vanilla, cinnamon, clove, honey, and salt. Bring just to a boil over medium heat; remove from heat. Pour 1/2 the cream through a sieve over the chopped chocolate and let sit for a minute. After 1 minute, gently stir the cream and chocolate mixture with a spatula, starting in the center and slowly working toward the outside of the bowl (in a slow circular motion). Remove cinnamon stick and clove and discard. Add the remaining cream and stir as directed above, then stir in the butter. The molten chocolate, cream, and butter will blend slowly, then become smooth and glossy (this glossiness is a good sign that the suspension is stable). Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, pressing the film onto the surface of the chocolate to prevent a thin skin from forming. Refrigerate until firm, approximately 1 hour.</p>
        <p>Remove the chilled ganache from the refrigerator. Scout out 1/2 ounce balls of the chocolate (about the size of a Bing cherry) and place them on a baking sheet covered with either parchment or wax paper; return them to the refrigerator.</p>
        <p>Dip the truffles and then toss into the cocoa powder or decorate as desired.</p>

        <p>--These were introduced to me as squares and I've done them as squares.</p>
        <p>--Because it is hard to find 6 loaf pans, I always use other containers, but</p>
        <p>that means that they aren't completely uniform.</p>
        <p>--These are hard to cut. If they are too cold, they crack or separate. If they</p>
        <p>are too warm, they stick.</p>
        <p>--Always warm up the chocolate layer just a bit before pouring on white</p>
        <p>chocolate because otherwise they won't adhere properly.</p>
        <p>--I like the dots we used as decoration this year. They were fun.</p>

        <p MadCap:conditions="Truffle set.Web">1. Pom syrup varies in concentration. I used Dynamic Health’s 100% pure pomegranate syrup, which is 5x more concentrated than pom juice.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Truffle set.Web">2. In an alternate recipe calling for heavy cream and maple syrup in addition to pom syrup, the pom syrup curdled the cream.

        <p MadCap:conditions="Truffle set.Web">Notes:</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Truffle set.Web">•	This ganache turned out very soft and could use some more tweaking. The original recipe calls for 9 oz. of chocolate, which I increased to 10 oz.; 11 or 12 oz. might be even better.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Truffle set.Web">•	The original recipe does not call for lemon extract, but the Meyer lemon flavor was so subtle that I felt it was needed. For the 2007 batch, I added 1 1/2 teaspoons, but a little less would have been fine, too. One reviewer at the Epicurious site said she added some limoncello liqueur.</p>
