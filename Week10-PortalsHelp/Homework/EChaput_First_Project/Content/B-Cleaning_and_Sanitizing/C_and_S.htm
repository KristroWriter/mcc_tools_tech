        <p class="B1_Body1">Cleaning is often called a chore. For some it’s a loathsome activity. For others it’s an opportunity to see clear-cut results of their efforts. But does a home really need to be cleaned? And if so, how often? </p>
        <p class="B1_Body1">Yes, a home needs to be cleaned, but what parts and how often are quite variable—in fact too many variables to list here!</p>
        <p class="B1_Body1">Cleaning can help mitigate environmental factors that affect our health. However, almost everything is best in moderation. Cleaning beyond what is necessary can damage an item in addition to introducing more chemicals into the environment.</p>
        <p class="B1_Body1">In the following chapter is a quick start guide to cleaning this spring. Before you know it, you’ll be sitting back enjoying the fruits of your labor.</p>

        <p class="_4H_Heading4">Spring Cleaning List</p>
        <p class="N1_Number" MadCap:autonum="1. ">Dust fan blades and vents</p>
        <p class="NN_NumberNext" MadCap:autonum="2. ">Wipe down walls and ceilings of bathrooms/kitchen, dust walls and ceilings of other rooms (stick a washcloth on the end of a Swifter for an easier job)</p>
        <p class="NN_NumberNext" MadCap:autonum="3. ">Clean/dust blinds, window sills and trims, and baseboards</p>
        <p class="NN_NumberNext" MadCap:autonum="4. ">Clean bedding (sheets, duvet, comforter)</p>
        <p class="NN_NumberNext" MadCap:autonum="5. ">Clean windows/mirrors</p>
        <p class="NN_NumberNext" MadCap:autonum="6. ">Deep clean floors (vacuum then scrub, mop, or carpet clean depending on the floor)</p>
        <p class="NN_NumberNext" MadCap:autonum="7. ">Replace air filter</p>
        <p class="NN_NumberNext" MadCap:autonum="8. ">Clean pillows (beds and couches)</p>
        <p class="B1_Body1">Keep in mind this list is minimal. There are many more items that could be added, but being manageable is key. Also, there are several items on this list that in an ideal world would be happening weekly if not monthly (i.e. sheets should definitely be cleaned more than just in the spring). </p>

            </a>Washing vs Sanitizing</p>
        <p class="B1_Body1">Washing, cleaning, sanitizing, disinfecting, sterilizing...is there a difference? There is.</p>
        <p class="Bu1_Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• ">Cleaning (washing): Removes dirt and makes things <span class="_Override" style="font-style: italic;">look</span>  and <span class="_Override" style="font-style: italic;">smell</span> clean.</p>
        <p class="Bu1_Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• ">Sanitizing: Removes bacteria from surfaces (think kitchen surfaces).</p>
        <p class="Bu1_Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• ">Disinfecting: Kills harmful bacteria and viruses on surfaces (think bathrooms or kitchen surfaces if your kitchen is a catch-all for eating and cleaning) .</p>
        <p class="Bu1_Bullet1" MadCap:autonum="• ">Sterilizing: Kills all microorganisms on surfaces (think hospital level cleaning).</p>
        <p class="B1_Body1">When spring cleaning, the focus is on cleaning, not getting rid of bacterial and viral contaminants. However, if after cleaning certain surfaces you want to sanitize or disinfect, go to town!</p>
        <p class="B2_Body2">&#160;</p>
        <p class="B1_Body1">In general, a good strategy for cleaning/sanitizing/disinfecting is:</p>
        <p class="StartStep">&#160;</p>
        <p class="S1_Step_1" MadCap:autonum=" &#160;Step 1. ">Remove loose dirt and or debris with a dry cloth or vacuum.</p>
        <p class="SN_StepNext" MadCap:autonum=" &#160;Step 2. ">Wash item with appropriate cleaner </p>
        <p class="B2_Body2">Dish soap, vinegar, baking soda, borax, and hydrogen peroxide are cheaper and easier on the lungs, eyes, and environment. However, they may take a little more elbow grease.</p>
        <p class="SN_StepNext" MadCap:autonum=" &#160;Step 3. ">Rinse.</p>
        <p class="B2_Body2">Often overlooked, it’s important to remove the cleaning residue as it will attract dirt back to the surface.</p>
        <p class="SN_StepNext" MadCap:autonum=" &#160;Step 4. ">Apply sanitizer or disinfectant</p>
        <p class="B2_Body2">This could come in the form of a spray or a wipe. </p>
        <p class="SN_StepNext" MadCap:autonum=" &#160;Step 5. ">Let the surface air dry or wipe after a set time.</p>
        <p class="B2_Body2">The effects of either is often dependent on the amount and time spent on the surface being targeted.</p>
        <p class="StepRule">&#160;</p>

            </a>What should be cleaned on a schedule and what can wait?</p>
        <p class="B1_Body1">This is a  question that can only be answered by you (sorry!). Every person has a life schedule in varying environments with different family/pet dynamics that will dramatically alter what needs attention for cleaning.</p>
        <p class="B1_Body1">A good rule of thumb to keep from going insane with the number of cleaning activities or conversely, by the dirt in your home, is set aside an hour over the weekend or fifteen to thirty minutes a day during the week to clean and organize and prioritize the spaces you spend the most time.</p>
        <p class="B1_Body1">It’s good to keep in mind that a home worth living in isn’t necessarily the one without dust, dirt, bacteria, and viruses, but instead a place where people feel comfortable, breathe at ease, and have time to enjoy each other.  </p>
