### This is a heading 3

Working with inline markup. _This_ should be italic. Also *this too* should be italic.
For bold use __two__ underscores or **two** asterisks. You may be able to use ~strike through~.
The other inline is `monospace fonts`

Experimenting with *file_name_with_underscores* or _file_name_with_underscore_
