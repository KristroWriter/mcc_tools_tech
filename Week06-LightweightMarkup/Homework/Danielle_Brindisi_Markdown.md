Tableau is a type of data visualization software. You can use raw data sets that your organization may generate, or you can upload data found on the web. Tableau allows you to see a clear picture of what your data looks like. It is useful for companies to showcase their data to other executives or employees. Tableau creates interactive dashboards that allows users to showcase their data. It is a handy tool that will help you immensely.
