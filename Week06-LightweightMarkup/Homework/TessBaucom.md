# How to Bake a Dark Chocolate Cake!

Gluten free and super delicious!

### Tools and Equipment:
* 2 mixing bowls
* A stand mixer or hand beater
* A rubber spatula
* 1 or 2 metal cake trays
* A toothpick or knife (for checking when cake is done)
* A wire cooling rack

## Ingredients
Amount | Ingredient
------ | ----------
1 3/4 Cups | Gluten free flour
1 Cup | Light brown sugar
3/4 Cups | Dark brown sugar
1 Cup and 2 Tbsp | Unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 Tsp | Baking powder
2 1/2 Tsp | Baking soda
2 Tsp | Espresso powder
1 Tsp | Salt
1/2 Cup | Vegetable or Canola Oil
2 Eggs | Large, room temp eggs
3/4 Cup | Sour cream or plain yogurt
1/2 Cup | Buttermilk
2 1/2 Tsp | Vanilla Extract
1/2 Cups | Hot water or coffee
1 Cup | Semi sweet chocolate chips


## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to **350Â°F**. Grease the cake pans with spray or butter. You can also use parchment paper on the bottom to help prevent sticking.
2. Whisk together the **flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt,** and **espresso powder**. *Set the bowl aside.*
3. In a stand mixer (or large mixing bowl with a hand beater), mix together the **oil, eggs,** and **sour cream** on medium-high speeds until well combined. Beat this mixture until it has *doubled or tripled in volume,* as the extra airiness aids in keeping the cake light and airy without the help of gluten.
4. Add the __buttermilk__ and **vanilla extract** and mix until combined.
5. Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and fold them together with the rubber spatula. Once combined, fold in the chocolate chips.
  + **_Note!_ Do not overmix at this step, as it will deflate the cake.**
6. Pour the batter evenly into the two cake pans.
7. Bake for **19-23 Minutes**. Use the knife or toothpick and insert into the center of the cake; when removed, there should be little to no crumbs. 
8. Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool completely on the wire rack.
  + **_Note!_** It's not the end of the world if you taste a little bite while it's cooling. Who can resists? It won't ruin the whole cake and you get to finally taste your hard work.

#### Notes:
Gluten free cake:

Gluten is a protein in flour that helps cakes and bread loafs rise and keep their airy, bubbly shape. This recipe adds extra baking powder, baking soda, and extra air into the whipped eggs to make up for the lack of structure normally provided by gluten. I've made this recipe several times, and people often comment that it doesn't "taste" (or feel) gluten free!
	
	
The espresso powder helps bring out the chocolate flavor. It is not necessary, but very delicious.


This recipe goes amazing with a coffee buttercream frosting. When the cakes are baking in the oven, it's a good time to make a frosting. Here's a recipe you can follow, although I substitue instant coffee with espresso powder since it's already on hand for this recipe:
