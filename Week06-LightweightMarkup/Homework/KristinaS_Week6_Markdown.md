# How To Cure the Hiccups

Hiccups 
are 
a 
spasm
of
the 
diaphragm, 
resulting 
in 
a 
"hic" 
noise 
repeating 
every 
couple 
of 
seconds 
or 
so. 
Most 
people 
have 
experienced 
the 
hiccups 
as 
an 
annoying 
distraction  
that 
can 
sometimes 
be 
difficult 
to 
cure 
right 
away. 
Hiccups 
that 
extend 
for 
a 
lengthy 
amount 
of 
time 
can 
be 
exhausting 
and 
disruptive. 

Common
techniques
for 
curing
the 
hiccups
include
holding 
your 
breath
or 
trying 
to 
scare
them
away.
These
techniques
often
do
not
work.
Usually 
the
hiccups 
will
soon
go
away
on
their
own.
The 
following 
is 
an 
effective 
technique 
for 
curing 
the 
hiccups
quickly.

Follow these steps:
1. Fill a  tall glass with water. 
1. While standing, put your mouth on the edge of the glass furthest away from you.
1. Bend forward at a 90 degree angle with head down.
1. Without stopping for breath, take 11 sips of water from the same outer edge of the glass. 
1. Stand up.
1. If hiccups remain, repeat one more time.

Preparation | Position | Technique

Fill tall glass with water | Put mouth on edge of glass furthest away from mouth | Without stopping for breath, take 11 sips of water
Have cloth to wipe up spills | Bend over at 90 degree angle with head down | Repeat process once if hiccups still present





## Warning!

* Water will likely spill on the floor during this activity. Have a cloth nearby to wipe up spills.
* If hiccups remain after two attempts, do not continue to drink water. Drinking too much water can be dangerous. 
* Sometimes hiccups can be related to a medical condition. If your hiccups don't go away, call your doctor.
