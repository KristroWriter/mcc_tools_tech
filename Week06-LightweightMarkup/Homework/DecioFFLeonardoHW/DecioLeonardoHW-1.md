Finally, I was able to know why I am at this page. It appears that I am at the right place, and in the proces I learned a few things.   

- How to properly use a mouse, and obesrve a mouse malfunction.
- Search for help when all else fails.
- Start the task with a fresh rested mind.
- Make notes as the task goes, it helps in observing areas that might be easily overlooked. 

### It starts with the mouse

Only recently did I start to use my mouse in right-click.  Today, I learned that my mouse is malfuctioning.   
After much looping into frustration, and reving my notes.  I *lerned* that in my computer, for the right-click to function *properly*, I must click it a few times until the **Open popup window** is repelaced by **View..Customize window**. After much Google searching and Microsoft searches, appears that I should have a professional fixing the mouse malfunction.  Otherwise I might be trapped in an endless time efort or ending  up maying montly fees for a program to update or correct the situation.
