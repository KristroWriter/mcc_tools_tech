## Introduction

### What is Mailmeteor

Mailmeteor is an email marketing platform for Gmail. It allows the user to send personalized mass emails (aka – mail merge) with Gmail. This plugin is desgined to work with Google Sheets and Gmail to accomplish this.

### Who Might Use Mailmeteor?

Mailmeteor is ideal for anyone who needs to send out a large number of personalized emails. Administrative Assistants are likely to be the prime user of this product, though many others would find this useful, such as teaching staff.

### How Does It Work?

Drawing on data in a Google Sheet that includes recipient email addresses, the user can compose an email drawing from the data in the sheet to personalize each email sent. 

This is more effective and time-saving than sending individual emails or a generic un-personalized email to a group.

### Types of Accounts

There are two types of accounts that may be appropriate for your educational institution.

An individual free account allows you to send 50 free emails per day through Mailmeteor. Attachments are not allowed.

The free education program offers a free account to all staff and students at a school, college, or university and provides complete access to Mailmeteor's Premium features which includes a 500 emails per day sending quota and allows attachments. The Free Education Program must be installed by the Google Administrator domain-wide.

The instructions included in this document cover only the process of creating a mail merge campaign regardless of the type of account you are using.

You will need the following:

* Gmail account (If you are using the free education program, the email must end in .edu.)

   ## Creating a Mailmerge from the Dashboard
   
   You can send an email directly from the Mailmeteor dashboard without using a Sheet. Personalization is not an option if you merge from the dashboard. This is perfect for general announcements for which you want to keep the email addresses of other recipients private. If you would like to use this option, please refer to the *Mailmeteor Dashboard* quick reference sheet.
