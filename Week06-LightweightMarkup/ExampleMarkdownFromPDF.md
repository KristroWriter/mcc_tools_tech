# Example Markdown

Excluding the title and this paragraph, this file contains the sample markdown
in `markdown.pdf` so you can see how it renders.

this
will
render
as
a
single
paragraph

This is a new paragraph

This is a paragraph with no preceding spaces.

     This is a new paragraph preceded by five spaces, so it should be indented.

  This is a new paragraph with only two preceding spaces, so it probably won't be indented.
  
  _This_ or *this* will be italic.
  
  **This** or __this__ will be bold.
  
  Make `this text` monospace.
  
  Use the tilde to ~~strikethrough~~ text.
