# This is a heading

This is a paragraph. Make sure there is an empty line above and below it.

## This is a heading 2

Here is another paragraph.

This
is
also
another
paragraph.

This

should

be

separate.

 - List item 1
 - List item 2
 - list item 3
 
 * A different list
 * another list
 * yet another item.
   * this is a nested bullet 
   * I hope
   
     This should be _aligned_ with *also italic* the second bullet.
	 
For numbered lists, just use 1.
For bold use two __underscores__ or **stars**

1. This is item 1
   With some extra text
   
   and maybe more text. What does it do to the list?
   
1. This is item 2
1. This is item 3

Have a paragraph.

1. what number is this?
