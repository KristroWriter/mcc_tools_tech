    <title>About short descriptions</title>
    <shortdesc>Every topic can have a short description, and should.</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>Use the <xmlelement>shortdesc</xmlelement> element to provide a short description of your
            topic. In general, it should be just a sentence or two, just text. In fact, some
            automatic checkers complain when your <xmlelement>shortdesc</xmlelement> is over 50
            words.</p>
        <p>It's more than just the introduction to your topic. Many DITA processors take the short
            description and use it with links. For example, if you transform your content into HTML,
            the short description content could be a popup when you hover over a link.</p>
        <image placement="break" href="art/linkPopup.png" align="center"/>
        <p>You can also configure DITA topics to generate various types of automatic links. These
            links can also pull in the short description.</p>
        <image placement="break" href="art/childTopics.png" align="center"/>
        <p>Short descriptions may also be weighted heavier for search results, which can improve your
            SEO (search engine optimization).</p>
        <p>Learning to write short descriptions is an artform, similar to a first paragraph in a
            news story. It is well worth practicing.</p>
        <p>When writing short descriptions, you want to avoid the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"This topic..."<p>Don't write a circular introduction. Think of this as the lead in
                    to an article. You want text that concisely describes the contents, and makes
                    people want to read it (if it's what they're looking for).</p></li>
            <li>Lead-ins to lists:<p>The short description is often used by tools as a brief
                    description of this topic. If you have a lead-in, the contents are usually
                    dropped from the link. Imagine a search result that just says "Read this to
                    learn:"</p></li>
            <li>Images<p>Not necessarily a no-no, but in the alternative ways short descriptions are
                    used, the image may not appear.</p></li>
            <li>Links<p>Again, not necessarily verboten, but if the text is showing in a pop-up, the
                    link may not work.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Writing good short descriptions is a common topic for presentations at conferences. It
            might be worth putting researching (and practicing) short description authoring on your
            to-do list.</p>
