    <title>About the Oxygen DITA Maps Manager</title>
    <shortdesc>This is a glorious panel in Oxygen that makes working with the topics in your map
        much easier. </shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>The major function of a map file is to be your table of contents. The <wintitle>DITA Maps
                Manager</wintitle> displays your map file in a hierarchical way. You can easily add
            new topics, reorganize your topics, and open topics to edit them from the <wintitle>DITA
                Maps Manager</wintitle>.</p>
        <p>Please remember that maps can do a whole lot more (relationship tables, key definitions,
            etc.), but for 90% of your DITA career, it's the file you use to control the structure
            of your topics.</p>
