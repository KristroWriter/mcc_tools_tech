                <li>Avoid using metal utensils that can scratch the seasoned surface of the pan. opt
                    for wooden or silicone utensils instead.</li>
                <li> Refrain from cooking highly acidic foods, such as tomato sauce or citrus-based
                    dishes for prolonged periods in your cast iron pan, as this can degrade the
                    seasoning. </li>
