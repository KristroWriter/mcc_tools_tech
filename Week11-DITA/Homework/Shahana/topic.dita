    <shortdesc>This is a sample topic. It is in your homework folder and is not shared.</shortdesc>
    <body>
        <p>This is the default, base topic type for DITA. This topic is not specialized in any way.
            Technically, you can use it any way you'd like. </p>
        <p>Here is another paragraph.</p>
        <p>Since this topic is not shared (it is not in the <filepath>common</filepath> folder, it
            is in your personal folder, <filepath><keyword keyref="homeworkfolder"/></filepath>),
            any changes you make to it will not affect anyone else's output.</p>
        <p>If you make changes to files in <filepath>common</filepath> folder, everyone gets the
            change. I humbly request you don't change the common files.</p>
        <p>You can change and add all the files you want in your folder,
                    <filepath>mcc_tools_tech/Week11-DITA/Homework/<keyword keyref="homeworkfolder"
                /></filepath>.</p>
