			<h1>Adopt a cat!</h1>
			<p>Cats can make for amazing and loving companions. Their independent nature allows for easier schedule flexibility around working and traveling. They're also great mice catchers!</p>
			<br />
			<p><h2>Starter items to buy when adopting a cat:</h2>
			<p><ul>
				<li>&#9642 Cat food</li>
				<li>&#9642 Food and water bowls</li>
				<li>&#9642 Cat litter</li>
				<li>&#9642 Litter box</li>
				<li>&#9642 Cat bed</li>
				<li>&#9642 A few cat toys!</li>
			</ul></p>
			<p>Now that you've got the essentials, you'll need to pick out a friend. Cats can have a variety of personalities, so you'll need to pick a buddy who will suite your personality, needs, and lifestyle. Do you want a lap cat? A good mouser? A cat who likes to be left alone? Going to a shelter to meet the cats is a good way to see which ones will fit your needs.

			<tr>
			<td><strong>Watney</strong></td>
			<td>Like a retired old man in a cat's body. Takes a lot of naps, likes to curl up where it's warm, and doesn't like to be disturbed. He'll sleep on your lap on occasion. He comes back from retirement to do some consulting work (catching mice).</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td><strong>Ellie</strong></td>
			<td>Ellie is Watney's energetic younger sibling. For as much as Watney likes his space to nap, Ellie has to be doing what he's doing at all times. She loves to run around and play with toys, but watch out - her claws are razor sharp! Whenever Watney is busy catching mice, she likes to watch him studiously as he works.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td><strong>Odie</strong></td>
			<td>Odie is a Utah resident, owned by the owners of an Airbnb. He's an outdoor cat, but very friendly and likes to be pet. He enjoys soaking up the sun, too! He's the unofficial greeter of the place, but with his friendliness and enthusiasm, they're happy to let him work for free.</td>
