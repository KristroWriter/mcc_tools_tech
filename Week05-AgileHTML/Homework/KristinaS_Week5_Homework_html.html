		<h2>Step 1: Making the Call</h2>
		<p>Each week you will be calling all fifty states and all the provinces and territories in Canada. Every morning your supervisor will provide you with a new list of states, provinces, and territories. Your supervisor will walk you through these steps when you first begin:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>1. Sign into your laptop with your user ID and password.</li>
			<li>2. Connect to the internet.</li>
			<li>3. Connect to the vpn.</li>
			<li>4. Right click on your assigned project.</li>
			<li>5. Right click on Make Calls.</li>
			<li>6. Click on a state, province, or territory.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The states, provinces, and territories will be listed in alphabetical order! You will not have time each day to make it through the whole list. If you always start at the top of the list, some places will never be reached. Devise a calling plan for yourself to reach all the states, provinces, and territories. See Table 2:</p>
