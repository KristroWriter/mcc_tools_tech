		<h2 title="Because winter should be only three months max">The month that will break your spirit.</h2>
			<p1>March. They say it's the beginning of spring, but truly, it's winter's last stand. Or at least it is in Massachusetts. </p1>
		</div>
		&nbsp
		<div>
		<p3><b>Here's why:</b></p3>
			<ul>
				<li>The leaves aren't even on the trees yet.</li>
				<li>There's almost always snow (over eight inches uring the month on average).</li>
				<li>It's freakin' windy--in like a lion and out like a lion.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Just look at the average temperatures...</h3>

						<p1>February's wicked cold with a couple teaser days in there, but we know it's still winter. April, not hot, but you can get away without a jacket and the days are getting long enough everything is turning green. And then there's March.</p1>		
		<h3>So what can you do about it?</h3>
			<p1>When life gives you lemons, make lemonade, especially in March because it's the only bit of warm sunshiny you're going to get. </p1> 
			<ol style="margin-left:-1em">
				<li>Plan for it suck. If you expect the worse and it happens, hey, you were prepared! If it doesn't happen, hey, bonus!</li>
				<li>Celebrate St. Patrick's Day. It really doesn't matter a bit if you're Irish. Have you ever met a person with a drop of Irish blood who didn't want to share a drink with someone else? Well, not their drink, but drink at the same time as you. Either way, it's a fun day to celebrate.</li>
				<li>Plant something in a cup and put it on your window sill. Something growing equals hope which is hard to come by in March.</li>
			</ol>
		<h3 style="margin-left:0em">Seriosly though...</h3>
			<p1>I love winter now even though shoveling stinks. It took me seventeen years to finally come to grips with Massachusetts winters, but up until then I was a bit cantankerous!<p1>
