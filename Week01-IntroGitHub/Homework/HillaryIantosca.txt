Getting to the meat and potatoes of why I'm here.
I've got a writing background in the medical field as well as experience teaching. I would like to merge both into the tech field.
I would like to use this semester to build a portfolio, then get a summer internship in tech writing. 
The fall 2024 component writing class is on my radar as well.
