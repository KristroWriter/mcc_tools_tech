My first homework…I’m using a Mac—trying to figure it out but getting a PC this weekend.

One step in the right direction...found the text editor for Macs. 

Why do people say "break a leg" when you go on stage?

:-D Groans ready? Because every play has a cast.

As I get older, these type of jokes actually make me laugh. The Three Stooges too. Twenty years ago I thought they were ridiculous. Now I laugh and even slap my knee while doing it! I'm a Dr. Rick Progressive commercial. 

Question—should I be deleting all previous content before starting new entries?

Thank you for the feedback! It's starting to feel more intuitive. Daily practice definitely helps!
