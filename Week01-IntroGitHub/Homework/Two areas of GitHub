The Two Areas of GitHub—working and storage (as I see it, thus far):
The working area of GitHub is with the local repo (repository—file storage), where your work is done on your computer; it is termed as “GitHub Desktop”, the other is GitHub Web.  On Desktop you should have a clone of the main repo.  In other words, all files on the main folder or storage area are also on your computer.  This clone should be updated regularly, or as often as you do any work.  By uploading your files—pushing into the main repository—the storage area, you are giving your pears and all authorized team members (those you forked with) the opportunity to edit your work.  Likewise, when you pull—download files (updated or otherwise), you have the opportunity to edit or comment on your pears’ files.  It is like having a main storage area where all files are safe, and you can retrieve or update when you want, and multiple people can work on the same file.  The only difference is that for your files to upload completely, the person in charge of the main repo or whoever has the authority must pull what you pushed.  In other words, you uploaded it and then, someone has to download it or accept the request for it to be stored and accessed.  There are sub-functions to work with within these functions mentioned.
