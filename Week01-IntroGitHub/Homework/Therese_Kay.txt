Hello World!
I've been a trainer and done some tech writing, but nothing that required versions and nothing outside of Word.

I'm looking forward to learning all the tools.

So, now I'm confused. I changed this on Thursday evening last week for a second time and it seems that it never finished doing its thing
I assume I left out a step so I'm making additional changes and am going to hope I do it properly this time !

OK, I'm practicing! I'm going to get this!


This is my third try. I may need to do this every day for the entire class but it's getting in there!

And this is now my 4th try. I *think* the third try went through, but I'm not entirely certain. BUT, I'm moving on.
I'm not sure why I keep getting the step in github confused but my brain will wrap around it eventually! I KNOW it will!!
